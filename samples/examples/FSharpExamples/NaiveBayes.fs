/// algorithm: one using F# Seq, a very similar one using DSet.fold, and a third using DSet.mapReduce.
/// Naive Bayes is usually implemented as a baseline with which to compare other machine learning algorithms, 
/// or as an introductory to ML algorithms due to its siplicity.
/// The "training" phase accumulates the number of times each word appears on each class, and "predict"
/// simply computes P(class|word), for all words, and P(class), and multiplies it all together, pretending
/// the words are all uncorrelated.
