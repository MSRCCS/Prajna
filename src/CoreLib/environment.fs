    Description: 
        The Environment class has two functions:

        1. Environment.Init()   
            Should be called by any program that needs to use DistributedFunction, and recommend to be used always
        2. CleanUp() 
            Free all resources, for a clean proper shutdown. 

        This class is pushed to the end so that it can use any class in Prajna Core.
